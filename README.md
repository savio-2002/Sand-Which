### Project Description
Sand-Which? is a quirky computer vision app that analyzes your half-eaten sandwich image using OpenCV and smart image processing, then suggests the most satisfying next bite. Because making the wrong choice is a recipe for regret. ü•™

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Choosing the next bite of a sandwich is a high-stakes decision‚Ä¶ that absolutely doesn‚Äôt need solving. Yet here we are. Why waste time thinking about calories when you can waste time thinking about the next bite?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Sand-Which?, a playful tool that scans your half-eaten sandwich and highlights the optimal next bite. No artificial intelligence, just some image processing, a bit of math, and a lot of overthinking your lunch.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV (image processing), NumPy, Pillow
- GitHub (version control), Pinterest (for sandwich images)

For Hardware:
- None required beyond a device with a web browser and internet connection
- Optional: A sandwich (for field testing)
- Camera or phone to take sandwich pictures

### Implementation
For Software:
# Clone the repo  
git clone https://github.com/tinkerhub/useless_project_temp.git  

# Move into the folder  
cd useless_project_temp  

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)  
python -m venv venv  

# Activate the virtual environment  
# Windows  
venv\Scripts\activate  
# macOS/Linux  
source venv/bin/activate  

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run
streamlit run app.py

### Project Documentation
For Software:

Flow:

User uploads a photo of a partially eaten sandwich

The app processes the image, finds edges, and locates the ‚Äúnext best bite‚Äù zone

Displays a zoomed-in view of the bite target with a fun UI background

Features:

Dark-themed foreground container for contrast

Background image fetched from Pinterest (because why not?)

‚ÄúRisky Bite Mode‚Äù for those who like danger in their sandwiches

Option to waste more time thinking about bites than calories

Limitations:

Not AI-powered ‚Äî but your sandwich will believe it is

Works best if you don‚Äôt eat the entire sandwich before uploading
